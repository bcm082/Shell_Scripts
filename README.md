## Simple shell scripts

1. [Shell script that takes a number as input and checks if it is equals to 10, greater than 10 and less than 10.](https://github.com/bcm082/bash_scripts/blob/main/1-If_Statement.sh)
2. [Shell script that takes a number as input and use while loop to print values decreasing order. ex. input=10, output: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1.](https://github.com/bcm082/bash_scripts/blob/main/1.1-While-Loop.sh)
3. [Shell script that takes a number as input and use while loop to display all the even digits within that number. ex input: 10 output: 2 4 6 8 10](https://github.com/bcm082/bash_scripts/blob/main/1.2-While_Do_Loop.sh)
4. [Shell script to identify if the input string is an integer, e.g., "is_int 1978" should display "1978 is an integer", and  "is_int Hahah12" should display "Hahah12 is not an integer"](https://github.com/bcm082/bash_scripts/blob/main/4-Check_Input.sh)
